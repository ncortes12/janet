            <h3>Who Am I? </h3>
            <p>I was born in Connecticut and spent my childhood between there and Rye, New York where I graduated high school. As a child, my Mom raised me in a home where tarot cards, saging the house, meditation, incense, yoga, crystal work, reiki, clean eating, no microwaves or cable TV, reading natal charts, and an overall kindness towards the world and others was life. Iâ€™ve always been a dreamer, someone who craves the ocean and likes to move. A lover of music and dance. For my college years I flew out West and spent seven years in Tucson, Arizona. This is where my personal yogic journey really took off. Out West is a very different environment than the East Coast...life tends to be slow and sweet. I studied Psychology and Sociology while exploring more yoga, taking up bicycling, enjoying nature, diving deeper into the chakras, and adapting to a different type of open-minded lifestyle than the one I had always known. I became fascinated with how the world is a balance of energy and how for every good there is bad, for every light there is dark, and so on. I firmly believe that being a positive genuine being will help to change the world we live in. So, you down?
